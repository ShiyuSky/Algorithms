Implementation for algorithms and data structures

## Sorting

**Quicksort**:

Although worst case runtime is O(n^2), which is worse than many other sorting algorithms, the worst case rarely occurs in real world. Its average case runtime is O(nlogn), which can be achieved by carefully selecting the pivot.

## Data Compression
- Run Length Encoding

## Others
- Convex Hull
